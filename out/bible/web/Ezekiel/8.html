                    <span class="verse-text">So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall.</span>

                    <span class="verse-text">Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh ’s house which was toward the north; and I saw the women sit there weeping for Tammuz.</span>
                </p>
                
                <p id="v15" class="verse" data-verse="Ezekiel.8.15" data-anchor="#v15">

                    <span class="verse-text">He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh ’s house; and I saw at the door of Yahweh ’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs toward Yahweh ’s temple and their faces toward the east. They were worshiping the sun toward the east.</span>
